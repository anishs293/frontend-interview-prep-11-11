1. Design Systems: Focused on UI Consistency and Reusability
A Design System is a collection of reusable components, styles, guidelines, and best practices that ensure consistent design across a product or suite of products. It focuses primarily on the visual and experiential aspects of frontend development, aiming to create a unified look and feel.

Key Elements of Design Systems:
Component Library: A library of reusable UI components (buttons, forms, modals, etc.) that follow consistent styling and functionality. For example, each button or form input should have a unified appearance and behavior across the app.
Style Guide: Consistent styling guidelines, including color palettes, typography, spacing, icons, and animations. These guidelines ensure that designers and developers use consistent visuals.
Accessibility Standards: Guidelines and components built to support accessibility, ensuring that the application is usable by all people, including those with disabilities.
Documentation and Guidelines: Rules and usage documentation that guide developers and designers on how to use components and styles properly.
Purpose:
Consistency and Brand Cohesion: Design systems ensure that every part of the UI aligns with the brand and provides a cohesive experience to users.
Efficiency and Reusability: By reusing components, development speed is improved, and code duplication is reduced.
Scalability: A design system scales well across teams and projects, making it easier to maintain consistency even as applications grow.
Examples in the Industry:
Material-UI: Developed by Google, it provides a set of UI components that follow Material Design principles.
Bootstrap: Provides reusable CSS components and JavaScript plugins for consistent design.
Ant Design: A React-based design system widely used for building enterprise applications.
In summary, Design Systems focus on UI/UX consistency, reusability, and brand alignment. It is more about how things look and feel across the application rather than the underlying technical architecture
