## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSubArray = function (nums) {
    let maxSoFar = -Infinity;
    let currSum = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        currSum += num;
        if (currSum > maxSoFar) {
            maxSoFar = currSum;
        }
        
        if (currSum < 0) {
            currSum = 0;
        }
    }
    return maxSoFar;
};
```

### Problem Explanation

The task is to find the subarray with the largest sum in an integer array `nums` and return its sum. The challenge is to do this efficiently without recalculating sums for overlapping subarrays.

## Approach: Kadane's Algorithm

We’re using **Kadane’s Algorithm**, an optimal solution with **O(n)** time complexity. This algorithm tracks the sum of the current subarray and updates the maximum sum when it encounters a higher sum.

---

### Code Walkthrough

1. **Initialize `maxSoFar` and `currSum`**:
    
    ```javascript
    let maxSoFar = -Infinity;
    let currSum = 0;
    ```
    
    - `maxSoFar` stores the maximum sum we’ve seen so far. It is initialized to `-Infinity` to handle cases where all numbers in the array are negative.
    - `currSum` keeps track of the current subarray sum as we iterate through the array. It starts at 0.

2. **Iterate Through Each Element**:
    
    ```javascript
    for (let num of nums) {
    ```
    
    - We loop through each element (`num`) in the array.

3. **Accumulate the Current Sum**:
    
    ```javascript
    currSum += num;
    ```
    
    - We add the current element to `currSum`, building our subarray sum as we go. This step allows us to keep growing the subarray while the sum is positive.

4. **Update `maxSoFar` If `currSum` Is Larger**:
    
    ```javascript
    if (currSum > maxSoFar) {
        maxSoFar = currSum;
    }
    ```
    
    - If `currSum` is greater than `maxSoFar`, we update `maxSoFar`. This keeps track of the highest subarray sum encountered so far.

5. **Reset `currSum` If It’s Negative**:
    
    ```javascript
    if (currSum < 0) {
        currSum = 0;
    }
    ```
    
    - If `currSum` becomes negative, we reset it to 0. This is a critical part of Kadane’s Algorithm because if the current subarray sum goes below 0, it means it’s dragging down any future sums. Resetting to 0 effectively “discards” the current subarray and starts fresh from the next element.

6. **Return `maxSoFar` After Looping Through the Array**:
    
    ```javascript
    return maxSoFar;
    ```
    
    - After the loop finishes, `maxSoFar` holds the maximum sum of any subarray within `nums`, which we then return as the result.

### Example Walkthrough

Let’s say `nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`. Here’s how Kadane’s Algorithm processes each element:

1. Start with `currSum = 0` and `maxSoFar = -Infinity`.
2. Iterate over each element:
    - `currSum = -2` → reset to 0 since it’s negative.
    - `currSum = 1` → `maxSoFar` becomes 1.
    - `currSum = -3` → reset to 0.
    - `currSum = 4` → `maxSoFar` becomes 4.
    - Continue similarly, and at the end, `maxSoFar` is updated to 6 for the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.

The output is `6`, the maximum sum.

### Time Complexity

The **time complexity** is **O(n)** because we’re only traversing the array once, performing constant-time operations within the loop.

### Space Complexity

The **space complexity** is **O(1)** since we’re only using two extra variables (`maxSoFar` and `currSum`), regardless of the array’s size.

---

### Key Takeaway for Interviews

Kadane's Algorithm works by:

- Accumulating a running sum (`currSum`) while the sum is positive.
- Resetting `currSum` to 0 when it becomes negative, discarding subarrays that would reduce the potential maximum sum.
- Updating the maximum sum (`maxSoFar`) whenever we encounter a higher sum during the traversal.

This makes Kadane’s Algorithm both **efficient** and **easy to understand** for finding the maximum subarray sum.
