System Design: Focused on Architecture, Scalability, and Performance
System Design in frontend refers to the architectural patterns and high-level design considerations that support the scalability, performance, and maintainability of web applications. While it often involves backend and full-stack concepts, in the frontend context, system design also covers how to structure large-scale applications efficiently.

Key Elements of System Design in Frontend:
Client-Server Architecture: Understanding how frontend and backend communicate, including REST APIs, GraphQL, and WebSocket connections.
State Management: How to handle data in complex applications, often using libraries like Redux, Context API, or global state management solutions.
Micro-Frontends: A strategy for breaking down large frontend applications into smaller, independent deployable pieces. This allows for more flexible, scalable development, especially in large teams.
Caching Strategies: Techniques to cache data on the client side (e.g., using Service Workers or browser cache) to improve performance.
Rendering Strategies: Decisions around Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), which directly impact load times and SEO.
Code Splitting and Lazy Loading: Techniques to split and load code only when necessary, improving page load performance.
Purpose:
Scalability: Ensuring that the application can handle increased traffic or data without sacrificing performance.
Performance Optimization: Architecting the application for fast load times, efficient data fetching, and optimized rendering.
Maintainability: Creating a modular, organized codebase that can be easily maintained and expanded.
Reliability: Ensuring that the system can handle failure scenarios gracefully, especially in distributed architectures.
Examples in the Industry:
Client-Server Model: Nearly all web applications use this model for separating frontend and backend.
Micro-Frontend Architecture: Large companies like Amazon and Spotify use micro-frontends to allow independent teams to develop parts of the frontend independently.
Server-Side Rendering: Frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js offer SSR to improve performance and SEO in large applications.
In summary, System Design in frontend is about architectural planning, performance strategies, and scalable structure. Itâ€™s more technical and focuses on how things work under the hood rather than just how they appear.
